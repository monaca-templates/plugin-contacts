# Contacts Plugin Demo

This repository contains a simple project which demonstrates how to use the `cordova-plugin-contacts` plugin with Monaca.

It currently allows for listing of all contacts, choosing a single contact using the native interface, and searching for contacts by string.

It has been tested with version 2.3.1 of the plugin on the following devices:

 - iPhone X (iOS 11.0)
 - Nexus 5X (Android 8.0)
 - Galaxy S4 (Android 4.4.2)
